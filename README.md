# Predicting-Breast-Cancer <br>
## Overview <br>
Breast Cancer is the most often identified cancer among women and major reason for increasing mortality rate among women. As the diagnosis of this disease manually takes long hours and the lesser availability of systems, there is a need to develop the automatic diagnosis system for early detection of cancer. <br>
Data mining techniques contribute a lot in the development of such system. For the classification of benign and malignant tumour we have used classification techniques of machine learning in which the machine is learned from the past data and can predict the category of new input.

## Models Trained <br>
This repository is a relative study on the implementation of models using Logistic Regression, KNN Algorithm, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K – Support Vector Machines (K- SVM), Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest is done on the dataset taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data. <br>
With respect to the results of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity and False Positive Rate the efficiency of each algorithm is measured and compared. <br>
These techniques are coded in python and executed in Jupyter, the Scientific Python Development Environment. 

## Conclusion 
Our experiments have shown that Random Forest is the best for predictive analysis with an accuracy of 96.5%. We infer from our study that Random Forest is the well-suited algorithm for prediction
